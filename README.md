## Game Stories

1. **Stealing the Kohinoor**
   - You are an experienced thief who has conducted the world's most brilliant heists. Today, you decide to enter the Jewel House at the Tower of London and steal the most beautiful diamond the world has ever seen.

2. **Escaping Jail**
   - One of your fellow inmates hasn't been seen in a few days. They have gone missing. As you enter their room, you stumble upon a stack of letters under their bed. You open the first letter and are astonished. You have just found your way out of here. Follow the letters and escape jail to live as a free citizen!

3. **Mystery Murderer**
   - After being stumped by a complicated murder case, the police give in and invite you - an extremely talented private investigator - to solve the case. You create a board that helps you find the murderer as you play along.

## Game Mechanics

### B.R.E.A.K: Beat Riddles, Execute Actions, Keep moving

1. **Going Forward**
   - Players may only move in a specific order of rooms. You must solve one room before being able to view the next one.

2. **Time Constraint**
   - You must finish the entire game within 60 minutes. To aid the players, we have added a hint and solution button to every room, but beware - using these is not for free. If the player uses the hint button, they give up 2 minutes of their time, and if they use the solution button, they give up 5 minutes of their time.

3. **Going Back**
   - Players may not go back to a room they have already solved. Any rooms that require a previous solution are equipped with some feature that allows the player to view the previous problem.

## Player Experience

Players can move their avatar left and right in the room and hover over objects to find hidden clues. They have a submission box and a button to submit their responses. Based on whether their answer is correct or incorrect, they can move on to the next room or must try again in the same room, respectively. Incorrect answers trigger a specific sound, while correct answers play the sound of a door opening, accompanied by a graphical representation.

### Emotions and Design

We aim to evoke emotions of frustration and achievement, engaging players in deep thought. The game is intentionally designed to be moderately difficult, stimulating players intellectually and making them feel significant frustration or achievement based on their performance.
